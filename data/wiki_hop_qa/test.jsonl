It is commonly snorted, inhaled, or injected into the veins. Mental effects may include loss of contact with reality, an intense feeling of happiness, or agitation. Physical symptoms may include a fast heart rate, sweating, and large pupils. High doses can result in very high blood pressure or body temperature. Effects begin within seconds to minutes of use and last between five and ninety minutes. Cocaine has a small number of accepted medical uses such as numbing and decreasing bleeding during nasal surgery.\nCocaine is addictive due to its effect on the reward pathway in the brain. After a short period of use, there is a high risk that dependence will occur. Its use also increases the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, lung problems in those who smoke it, blood infections, and sudden cardiac death. Cocaine sold on the street is commonly mixed with local anesthetics, cornstarch, quinine, or sugar which can result in additional toxicity. Following repeated doses a person may have decreased ability to feel pleasure and be very physically tired.\nCocaine acts by inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine. This results in greater concentrations of these three neurotransmitters in the brain. It can easily cross the bloodbrain barrier and may lead to the breakdown of the barrier. Cocaine is made from the leaves of the \"coca\" plant which are mostly grown in South America. In 2013, 419 kilograms were produced legally. It is estimated that the illegal market for cocaine is 100 to 500 billion USD each year.

While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: \nEuropean art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \"ad libitum\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.", "Sergei Pavlovich Diaghilev (19 August 1929), usually referred to outside Russia as Serge, was a Russian art critic, patron, ballet impresario and founder of the Ballets Russes, from which many famous dancers and choreographers would arise.", "The harp is a stringed musical instrument which has a number of individual strings running at an angle to its soundboard, which are plucked with the fingers.

The term Renaissance is in essence a modern one that came into currency in the 19th century, in the work of historians such as Jules Michelet and Jacob Burckhardt. Although the origins of a movement that was confined largely to the literate culture of intellectual endeavor and patronage can be traced to the earlier part of the 14th century, many aspects of Italian culture and society remained largely Medieval; the Renaissance did not come into full swing until the end of the century.

The invasion is documented by Gregory of Tours who cited the now lost work of Sulpicius Alexander . According to this account Marcomer , Sunno and Genobaud invaded the Roman provinces Germania and Belgia in Gaul . They broke through the lines , killed many people , destroyed the most fruitful lands and made the city Cologne panic . After this raid , the main body of the Franks moved back over the Rhine with their booty . Some of the Franks remained in the Belgian woods .

The Franks delivered hostages as usual , and Arbogastes returned to his winter quarters in Trier . A couple of years later when Arbogastes had seized power and the West Roman army was nearly completely in the hands of Frankish mercenaries , he crossed the Rhine with a Roman army into Germania , because he hated his own kin .

There is no known behavioral activity or environmental factor that changes the possibility.

Since the introduction of screening, pregnancies with the diagnosis are often terminated. Regular screening for health problems common in Down syndrome is recommended throughout the person's life.\nThere is no cure for Down syndrome. Education and proper care have been shown to improve quality of life. Some children with Down syndrome are educated in typical school classes, while others require more specialized education. Some individuals with Down syndrome graduate from high school and a few attend post-secondary education.

It includes anything conducted by surface ships, amphibious ships, submarines, and seaborne aviation, as well as ancillary support, communications, training, and other fields; recent developments have included space-related operations. The strategic offensive role of a navy is projection of force into areas beyond a country's shores (for example, to protect sea-lanes, ferry troops, or attack other navies, ports, or shore installations).

The strategic task of the navy also may incorporate nuclear deterrence by use of Submarine-launched ballistic missiles.

Among the many individuals and organizations that operate in the industry are: the songwriters and composers who create new songs and musical pieces; the singers, musicians, conductors and bandleaders who perform the music; the companies and professionals who create and sell recorded music and/or sheet music (e.g., music publishers, music producers, recording studios, engineers, record labels, retail and online music stores, performance rights organizations); and those that help organize and present live music performances (sound engineers, booking agents, promoters, music venues, road crew).", "Mott the Hoople is the debut studio album by the band of the same name . It was produced by Guy Stevens and released in 1969 by Island Records in the UK ( cat . no. ILPS 9108 ) , and in 1970 by Atlantic Records in the US ( cat . no. SD 8258 ) . It was subsequently re-released by Angel Air in 2003 ( SJPCD157 ) . Stevens , the group 's initial mentor and guide , wanted to create an album that would suggest Bob Dylan singing with the Rolling Stones . This was partially achieved , with the album including several Dylanesque cover versions along with aggressive rock originals . Years later , vocalist Ian Hunter - who had only just joined the band prior to Mott the Hoople 's recording and had yet to play live with them - would insinuate , in an August 1980 Trouser Press magazine interview , that the Stones ' 1971 track `` Bitch '' bore more than a passing resemblance to this album 's `` Rock and Roll Queen . '' ( Both songs are in the key of Am , and use the pentatonic scale . ) An instrumental version of The Kinks ' `` You Really Got Me '' introduces the album , though a vocal version was recorded and is available on Mott 's compilation release Two Miles From Heaven .

'' Initial copies of the album were wrongly pressed with the song `` The Road to Birmingham , '' the B - side of their debut single , replacing `` Rock and Roll Queen . '' The album 's cover is a colourised reproduction of M. C. Escher 's lithograph `` Reptiles . '' In an interesting coincidence considering Guy Stevens ' desire for Mott to sound like the Rolling Stones , in early 1969 Mick Jagger had approached Escher wanting to commission a painting for the cover of the Stones ' upcoming album Let It Bleed ; Escher declined the request .", "Led Zeppelin were an English rock band formed in London in 1968. The group consisted of guitarist Jimmy Page, singer Robert Plant, bassist and keyboardist John Paul Jones, and drummer John Bonham.
